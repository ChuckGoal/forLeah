<h1>For Leah</h1>
Had we but world enough, and time,<br/>
This coyness, Lady, were no crime<br/>
We would sit down and think which way<br/>
To walk and pass our long love’s day.<br/>
Thou by the Indian Ganges’ side<br/>
Shouldst rubies find: I by the tide<br/>
Of Humber would complain. I would<br/>
Love you ten years before the Flood,<br/>
And you should, if you please, refuse<br/>
Till the conversion of the Jews.<br/>
My vegetable love should grow<br/>
Vaster than empires, and more slow<br/>;
An hundred years should go to praise<br/>
Thine eyes and on thy forehead gaze;<br/>
Two hundred to adore each breast,<br/>
But thirty thousand to the rest;<br/>
An age at least to every part,<br/>
And the last age should show your heart.<br/>
For, Lady, you deserve this state,<br/>
Nor would I love at lower rate.<br/>
But at my back I always hear<br/>
Time’s wingèd chariot hurrying near;<br/>
And yonder all before us lie<br/>
Deserts of vast eternity.<br/>
Thy beauty shall no more be found,<br/>
Nor, in thy marble vault, shall sound<br/>
My echoing song: then worms shall try<br/>
That long preserved virginity,<br/>
And your quaint honour turn to dust,<br/>
And into ashes all my lust:<br/>
The grave’s a fine and private place,<br/>
But none, I think, do there embrace.<br/>
Now therefore, while the youthful hue<br/>
Sits on thy skin like morning dew,<br/>
And while thy willing soul transpires<br/>
At every pore with instant fires,<br/>
Now let us sport us while we may,<br/>
And now, like amorous birds of prey,<br/>
Rather at once our time devour<br/>
Than languish in his slow-chapt power<br/>
Let us roll all our strength and all<br/>
Our sweetness up into one ball,<br/>
And tear our pleasures with rough strife<br/>
Thorough the iron gates of life:<br/>
Thus, though we cannot make our sun<br/>
Stand still, yet we will make him run.<br/>
